    <h1>Neapolitan Style Pizza Dough</h1>
    <img class="dish-img" src="../images/pizza.jpg" alt="pizza">
    <h2>Description</h2>
        
    <p>Authentic Neapolitan pizza originates from the birthplace of pizza, Naples. It involves traditional methods and ingredients that have been largely forgotten for quite a while.</p>
    <p>This is perhaps the most authentic Neapolitan pizza recipe you will find! What’s more, it’s really easy with just 4 ingredients; flour, water, salt, and yeast.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour – 640g</li>
            <li>Water (room temperature) – 360g</li>
            <li>Salt (fine) – 14g</li>
            <li>Yeast (dried or fresh) – around 0.2g to 0.5g (depending on yeast type & room temperature)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients into a shaggy mass in a large bowl, starting by adding the water first. You can do this by hand or use a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with cling film, a plastic carrier bag, or a damp cloth (if the cloth isn’t damp the dough may dry out).</li>
            <li>Leave the dough to rest for around 1 hour (the technical term for this process is the Autolyse).</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead for around 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the dough back into the bowl and cover.</li>
            <li>Leave the dough to prove (in one big lump, don’t worry about the shape) for around 20 hours.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 4 equal parts (250g each) using some kitchen scales and a knife (or dough scraper). Do this about 4 hours before you intend to cook the pizza (after about a 20 hour prove).</li>
            <li>Place each dough ball into a small bowl and cover. Alternatively, use a large tupperware container with a lid, or two smaller ones.</li>
            <li>Leave the dough balls to prove again for about 4-6 hours.</li>
        </ol>
